# myresource
myresource operator deploys a frontend app which performs CRUD operations and stores the data in Postgres database in Kubernetes, GKE.

## Description
### Operator features
Operator is developed using Operator SDK framework. It deploys the frontend CRUD app as a Deployment and a database as StatefulSet. The database is backed by a PVC. The PVC can be extended by passing `true` value to `pvcExtensionNeeded` field in CR or Helm values.yaml. The operator is packaged into Helm chart for easy deployment. 

### CRUD App
The app has 4 APIs accessed internaly within the Pod's shell at the following path:
* `api/create` for Create
* `api/records` for Read
* `api/update` for Update
* `api/delete` for Delete

### Helm values.yaml
Helm Chart requires values for  `dbUser` `dbPassword`. This is hardecoded in values.yaml but should be passed as `--set' field to not expose the secrets.
The Helm chart is served from Github Pages and the repo can be added using:
```sh
helm repo add crud-app https://gauravkr19.github.io/myresource-operator
helm search repo
```
The operator can be installed with command:

```sh
helm install crudapp crud-app/myresource-operator  -f docs/charts/values.yaml  --namespace crudapp --create-namespace
```

The operator and the apps are installed in `crudapp` namespace created by helm, else will be deployed in `default` namespace
The installation fails without the values of `bUser`, `dbPassword` passed via `values.yaml`. These values are hardcoded for demo purpose.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/myresource:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/myresource:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
